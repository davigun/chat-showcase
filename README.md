# chat-showcase

Purpose

This app was created in order to demo my abilities for creating simple social media app. This app started out simple, and grew into something more complicated as I coded, featuring Firebase and Facebook Login, Stack View in Post Cell, Caching Image, Database referencing, Flattening data in Firebasee. The app demonstrates everything great about Swift, from Storyboards, Cocoapods for ALAMOFIRE, Facebook Plugin, Data Encapsulation, NSUserDefaults, best coding practices, MVC, error handling, clean design strategy. It's a wrap in here.
